                        <p>Over-hard, over-easy, sunny side up, inside out-- so many types of fried egg. It's just a matter of how hot and how long.</p>

                                    <li>1. Get a pan nice and hot on about medium-high heat.</li>
                                    <li>2. Add oil and/or butter and let heat for 30 seconds or so. (For a truly fried egg, don't be afraid of using a good amount of butter or oil.)</li>
                                    <li>3. Check that oil is hot enough by adding a drop of water...the water will tell you if the pan is hot enough.</li>
                                    <li>4. Being careful not to crack the yolk, break your egg into the pan.</li>
                                    <li>5. Here are some general cook times for various degrees of doneness:<br>
                                        &#9657 Sunny-side: 2 - 2.5 minutes on medium high. Season with salt and pepper, no flip.<br>
                                        &#9657 Over easy (runny yolk): Sunny-side + Flip and cook &asymp; 1 minute more. <br>
                                        &#9657 Over medium (slightly runny yolk): Over easy + Cook &asymp; 1 minute more <br>
                                        &#9657 Over hard (hard yolk): Over medium + Cook &asymp; 1 minute more<br>

                        <p>To many children, scrambled is the only legitimate way to eat an egg. And despite being a relatively easy preparation, there is a surprising amount of contention over how to best scramble eggs. Some like them cooked for an hour using ~residual heat~(shoutout to M.J.) while some prefer them on the creamier side. This recipe will yield light, fluffy.</p>

                                    <li>1. Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add milk or water and salt + pepper.</li>
                                    <li>2. Whisk or beat with a fork until the egg yolks and whites are incorporated evenly.</li>
                                    <li>3. Heat butter or oil in a pan over medium (non-stick or a seasoned cast iron is best).</li>
                                    <li>4. Add eggs to pan. Let them cook undisturbed for about a minute. </li>
                                    <li>5. Lift the edges of the eggs to allow uncooked parts to solidify.</li>
                                    <li>6. When most of the eggs have cooked, you can use your spatula to break the disk into smaller pieces or just flip it to ensure that all parts are cooked and serve.</li><br>
                                    <li>^LEVEL UP^: Add cheese, veg, or other things that make sense to you around step (5). If you haven't broken the egg up and are careful while flipping, you'll end up with something like a lazy omelet.</li>

                        <p>Probably the best hangover treatment on this list. Mumbai Disco Eggs originated with street vendors selling this dish outside of Mumbai clubs. Disco eggs are an excellent way to end a night out or to start your day.</p>

                        <p>Ramen and eggs: two favorites of the budget-conscious among us. While you could add a fried or boiled egg to your ramen, Chez Internet has delivered a more direct way to fuse egg and noodle. Disco eggs may be the optimal food to ameliorate a hangover, but the romelet is what you make before the hangover has begun to bloom. If you can stand up, you can make a romelet...just don't forget to turn the stove off afterward.</p>
